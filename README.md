Using SpringBoot to Create a website for "Oracle of Shaq"

<h5>What is Oracle of Shaq?</h5>
  Oracle of Shaq is a breadth first search of a graph made up of every NBA player in history. Each player is a node, with edges to every teammate they have ever had. Data scraped from <link src="basketball-reference.com">Basketball Reference</link> using JSoup. This was an excercise in graph theory and to learn Spring Boot for front end development.
